        <li>Music: Gigging musician in New Orleans for the last eight years, playing saxophone in various RnB, Funk, Blues, Jazz, Latin groups.</li>
        <li>Travel/Camping: Getting to travel the world and see the variety of landscapes, places, people, foods, cultures, etc that exist gives me a profound and lasting sense of joy.</li>
        <li>Crafting/Mardi Gras Subkrewe Co-Captain: I am co-captain of a parading subkrewe in the Chewbacchus Parade. This involves helping organize a group of 10-15 people as well as designing and crafting costumes and hundreds of throws to give to spectators each year.</li>
